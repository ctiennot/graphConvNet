# graphConvNet

MVA project for Graphs for machine learning course on the paper **Convolutional Neural Networks on Graphs with Fast Localized Spectral Filtering** [1].

The *src* folder contains the core implementations as python classes while the *notebooks* folder provides several (ordered) notebooks to demonstrate how to make use of the code.
